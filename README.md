Hi 👋, I'm @mxagar (Mikel Sagardia)!

I'm an engineer located in [San Sebastián](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebastián) (Basque Country / Spain).

I have a [PhD](https://elib.dlr.de/132879/) in the intersection between robotics, virtual simulations and human-machine interfaces. However, in the past 4 years my interest has shifted to

- **machine vision**,
- **machine learning**,
- and **data science**.

Currently, I'm on a leave of absence from my role as senior researcher at [Vicomtech](https://www.vicomtech.org/en). During this sabbatical I'll be collaborating with a limited number of teams as an external consultant. At the same time, I'll be building some business ideas 🌱. My [Github profile](https://github.com/mxagar) is a nice window to see what I'm [learning](https://github.com/mxagar/course_compilation) and [working on](https://github.com/mxagar/project_compilation) at each moment.

Previously, I've lived in Munich (Germany) for over 14 years -- bitte gleich auf Deutsch 🇩🇪 mit mir! There, I worked at the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-8017) (where the game-changer KUKA cobot was orginally conceived) and [MVTec](https://www.mvtec.com) (where the great Halcon machine vision toolkit is crafted).
